Technical Report
================
Introduction: 

This is my technical report, a continuation of assignment 1 for frameworks and languages. In this technical report, I intend to critique both server and client prototypes that have been provided by Freecycle. 
To do this I will take code snippets of each component and highlight key elements that I believe could be improved on and or written another way. During this process, I will explain why the pattern chosen is problematic covering multiple factors such as efficiency and ease of use. After covering both Server and client prototypes using the structure below, I will cover the solution I have created using frameworks. I will cover 3 features for each framework elaborating on how I have used it and its effectiveness. And to finalise this report I will justify using the evidence  I have used in the report itself why frameworks are good and should be used in most cases.

Critique of Server/Client prototype
---------------------

### Overview
The Server and client prototypes were both written without the use of frameworks. This isn't good because the amount of code needed to write minor elements of design and development is much higher than the need with server frameworks. I will now critique the prototype providing explanations as to why the code snippets have issues.
