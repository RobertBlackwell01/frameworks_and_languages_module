Technical Report
================

(This is my introduction:)
Introduction: This is my technical report, a continuation of assignment 1 for frameworks and languages. In this technical report, I intend to critique both server and client prototypes that have been provided by freecycle. 
To do this I will take code snippets of each component and highlight key elements that I believe could be improved on and or written another way. During this process, I will explain why the pattern chosen is problematic covering multiple factors such as efficiency and ease of use.
